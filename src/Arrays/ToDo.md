## The following questions have been carefully chosen to be addressed within this topic
#### For this topic I will be using only array data structure and off course the logic behind to implement them.
Arrays are always passed to function as 'pass by reference'

- [X] Barchart
- [X] Binary Search
- [X] Reverse the Array
- [X] Trapping Rain Water
- [X] Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks
- [X] Maximum Sub Array
- [X] Maximum Sub Array Sum
- [X] Pairs In Array



- Will add more on the way
