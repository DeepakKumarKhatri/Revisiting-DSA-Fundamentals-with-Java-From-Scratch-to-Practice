# Revisiting-DSA-Fundamentals-with-Java-From-Scratch-to-Practice

This repository is dedicated to revisiting my fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms, starting from scratch. I'll be using Java to implement the algorithms and solving real-world problems using the most commonly asked interview questions.

The journey starts with the basics, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, and progresses through more advanced topics, such as trees, graphs, and dynamic programming. Along the way, I'll be using Leetcode to challenge myself and test my understanding.
